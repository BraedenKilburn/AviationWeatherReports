# Aviation Weather Report

This is an aviation weather report website. You can retrieve airport information as well as METAR and TAF reports for a specified airport.

## This website will:

- Prompt the user for the desired airport's weather report
- Display the airport and weather details
- Utilize Responsive Design
- Dynamically update using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework
- Run a back-end server on Node.js to retrieve the station reports
- Retrieve saved airports using a REST API built with Express

### Background

There are many websites that provide this functionality already; however, I believe that they all are, typically, visually complicated. I hope to accomplish both **functionality** and **visual simplicity** in my project.

### Pages

- Home Page
- Airport Details
- METAR Information
- TAF Weather Forecast

### TODO

- Save results using AWS DynamoDB to cache results
