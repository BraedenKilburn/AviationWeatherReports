# Creative Project: Aviation Weather Report

This is an aviation weather report website.

## This website will:

- Prompt the user for the desired airport's weather report
- Display the airport and weather details
- Utilize Responsive Design
- Dynamically update using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework
- Run a back-end server on Node.js
- Save results using MongoDB
- Retrieve saved airports using a REST API built with Express

### Background

There are many websites that provide this functionality already; however, I believe that they all lack modern design and are, typically, visually unappealing. I hope to accomplish both **functionality** and **visual appeal** in my project. 

### Pages

- Home Page
- Airport Details
- METAR Information
- TAF Weather Forecast

### TODO

- Reduce video background size
- Reduce GET request time
- Tweak responsive design for better mobile viewing
